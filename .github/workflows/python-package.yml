# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a variety of Python versions
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions

#TODO: idea: only run a few unit tests in one branch and run all of them in master and consolidated development branch?
# It takes a long time to run all unit tests on GitHub and locally
# 13m 27s mins to run 68 successful unit tests on GitHub

#TODO: how do we run two workflows from two commits sequentially, not simultaneously?
#If there two commits pushed mins within each other, 2 workflows are going run simultaneously and they'll both fail cus they interfere with each other
#(they both interact with the same GCP project, BQ dataset)
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency

# There's a few mins delay (~5 mins) for status badge in README to update (passing vs failing)
